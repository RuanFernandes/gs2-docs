## Step 1: Open the Weapon Scripts Menu

1. Open the **Weapon Scripts** menu in your game.
2. Click on the **Add** button.
3. Enter the name of your script as `Test`.

## Step 2: Create Your Script

In the code editor, type the following code:

```gs2
function onCreated() {
    echo("Hello World!");
}
```

This script will display "Hello World!" into RC chat when your weapon script is saved.
